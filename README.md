Continued Fraction algorithm, implementation in python 2.7.

This file is a basic implementation of the continued fraction algorithm, takes in input any 2 Integer and returns the q-coeficient so that you get this:
a/b = q0 + 1(q1 + 1 (q2 + 1/(...(qn-1 + 1/qn))))

There might be some errors due to rounding errors and it goes in loop.
